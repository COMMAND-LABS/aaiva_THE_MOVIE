Welcome to `Advanced AI Video Automation THE MOVIE`.

So you know what youâ€™re getting yourself into, here are 3 examples of what we will be showing you how to generate and customize in the coming sections.

(play 3 showcases in the `showcase` folder)

The primary tools we'll be using are... 

- n8n (Starter Plan)
  - Comes with a 2-week free trial but afterwards is about $20/month for the Starter Plan
  - https://n8n.io/
- Airtable (FREE)
  - https://airtable.com/
- Dropbox (FREE)
  - https://www.dropbox.com/
- JSON2Video
  - Comes with some FREE credits but after they run out you'll need to pay $49.95
  - https://json2video.com/
  - FUN FACT: There is a free alternative to JSON2Video out there called the NCA Toolkit (https://github.com/stephengpope/no-code-architects-toolkit) but we will cover the NCA Toolkit in another video as using it gets a little bit technical. The JSON2Video API will do the job for this video. PRO TIP: When it comes to JSON2Video be sure to render very short videos in order to stretch your free credits as far as possible

Throughout this journey we will be using several additional tools too that will serve very specific needs but we'll do our best to suggest FREE workarounds in case you don't want to pay for them...

THE ADDITIONAL TOOLS I'M REFFERING TO ARE...

- ElevenLabs (https://elevenlabs.io/)
  - Free tier should be good
  - https://elevenlabs.io/pricing
- OpenAI API (https://platform.openai.com/)
  - Credits based
  - Expect to burn $5-$10 USD
- Leonardo AI (https://leonardo.ai/)
  - Web app ($12/month)
  - Leonardo.ai API ($9/month)
-  Fal.ai (https://fal.ai)
  - Credits based
  - Expect to burn $10-$20 USD

Got it?! This is going to be amazing. Let's get started!
