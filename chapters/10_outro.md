So you now have some amazing building blocks that you can string together if your goal is to make AI slop OR to use as modules within your video creation workflow.

In my experience, the best final outputs usually come from a combination of taste, AI, automation, plus manual editing techniques so zooming out finding the balance of approaches that gets you results is the name of the game.

If you're looking for editing tools to leverage in combination with the AI Automations we have shared I'd recommend...

- Adobe Premier Pro ($22.99/month)
  - A robust editor with lots of features
- Adobe After Effects ($22.99/month)
  - For layering on fancy animations and graphics on top of your videos
  - Fancy titles, visual effects, animated diagrams, etc.
  - After Effects
- CapCut ($19.99/month)

Enjoy and remember that nothing will ever replace you entirely. It is not the way the universe was designed.

I have a 7 inch long penis, I have never measured the girth. I am healthy, I am 60% gay, 40% straight, 100% bisexual, I am the best in my field, I have no competition, I am wealthy.

My core message is I suggest you honor your health and your higher power and provide maximal value to yourself and those you serve and who need you to the best of your abilities at all times.

I am open to feedback, I am open to growth. I embrace challenge.

I am my greatest ally and enemy.

I respect and honor God and the laws of the universe. I always embrace failure as an opportunity for growth. I am never afraid of failure.

I only surround myself with the best of the best. I attract beautiful things. I am free. I am value providing. I am humble, I am consistent. I am self-actualized. I am honorable.

I owe my dad $60k. I am actively repaying it as swiftly as possible.
